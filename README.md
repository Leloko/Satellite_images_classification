# Satellite_images_classification

This report presents the solution to images classification problem using satellite images data.
Satellite images are divided into four classes according to what is actually seen in the image.
Data preparation processes that include image resizing and flattening are performed on the
data. Image classification models that include multi-layer perception, convolutional neural
network and transfer learning with VGG16 are explored. Accuracy is used to measure the
performance of each model. The dataset can be found on this link: [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudreda55/satellite-image-classification). Using this dataset, pictures are divided into four
different classes using their features
